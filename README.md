## **WallMi - A Disabled friendly retail bot.** 

This project WallMi saw its inception in the WonderCoders Hackathon organized by Walmart. It is a disable friendly bot that can help customers know the inventory, chose items of their preference and checkout.

The following were used to create WallMi:
- ReactJS to create a basic interface. (Used create-react-app for the basic setup)
- Webkits Speech Recognition library for speech to text and text to speech functionality.
- DialogFlow to create and fire intents.

To use the project you can download the project, navigate to the src folder and run npm start.

Here is a screenshot of WallMi in action:
